# UFOs

## Overview
The objective of this challenge is to create a website with a dynamic table offering a thorough examination of UFO encounters by enabling viewers to simultaneously select several parameters such as city, state, country and shape in addition to the date.

## Results
Using the dataset of UFO, we created a dynamic table in the web page in order to search trough some searh boxes. (Date, city, state, country, shape)

Though the Html we include the functions we wanted the web page to contain and using our syle.css we gave the web page a better design.

## Summary

### Drawback
Making the table call to a database and appending the information to the database so you have a running record.

### Recommendations
 would be to set it up to call an api so the info on a webpage will be correct and updated.

 Keep the filter search botton so we can make it clear.
